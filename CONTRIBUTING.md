## Coding Standards

### Python Style
- Follow PEP 8 guidelines
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add docstrings to functions
- Keep functions focused and concise

### Example:
```python
def send_verification_email(to_email: str, verification_code: str) -> bool:
    """
    Send verification email to user
    
    Args:
        to_email: Recipient email address
        verification_code: 6-digit verification code
        
    Returns:
        bool: True if email sent successfully
    """
    # Implementation
    pass
```

### JavaScript Style
- Use ES6+ features
- Use camelCase for variables
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions small and focused

### HTML/CSS Style
- Use semantic HTML5 elements
- Keep styles in `<style>` tags or separate CSS files
- Use meaningful class names
- Ensure responsive design

## Testing
